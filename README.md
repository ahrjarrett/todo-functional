# perfunctory todo app

written in vanilla js, attempting functional style/tests

todo app todo:
- assignId function is stateful; make pure, or just remove it and handle logic in eventHandler?
- add a way to mark todo complete (add strike-through class)
- add a way to edit todos (double-click would be a nice touch)
- implement immutable data structures so you can apply ‘undo’ functionality
- for some reason, I can’t seem to add a new type to both the todo and filter todos select > options
